# Extended-project
Repository containing the coding and implementation of the information engine, using Qiskit and Python. The repository is split up into different cases, including a file for numerical analysis of matrices, files for each qubit number (1,2 etc) and an inventory of functions used throughout.

Additional python coding has been added for different plots, reproducing the results of Kagan Yanik et al (2020).

Numerical analysis has also been added for the 2023 Herrera Paper. The defined functions used in relevant files can be found in 'Herrera Energies'.
