# Extended-project
Repository containing the coding and implementation of the information engine, using Qiskit and Python. The repository is split up into different cases investogated over the course of the project. 

Qiskit files contain work consisting of qubit circuits and effects of Hamiltonians of energies.

Python coding, named Herrera attempt to reproduce results of a two qubit entangled bath. Due to lack of comparison with a un-entangled case, this was left and instead work began to focus on a qubit engine of similar design to the paper by Yanik.

Remaining files relate to the one qubit and two qubit heat engines and the effects of relevant Hamiltonian changes.
